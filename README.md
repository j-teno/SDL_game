# SDL_game
## What's that?
Simple sandbox for trying out [SDL2 library](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php) with C++. 
All the sources are based on tutorial https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/ plus some bugs of mine.

## What game?
There is no final game idea in my mind. It willl probably end up as something between tetris and pacman ;-)

## The code is so ugly! Learn how to code, dude
In the beginning I will follow one-source-file convention so don't expect any classes and high level wrappers for low level calls to library. Please don't judge my programming style then! ;-)
It will change as I'm finished with more lessons and feel confident to shape a game in any kind :-)

## TODO
* render some graphics
* use some keyboard
* put more objects
* make them move
* add sound effects
* add collision detection
* implement 'real' game engine
* seperate SDL from game's logic
* make it abstract
